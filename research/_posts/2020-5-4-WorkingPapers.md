**Reference Dependent Aspirations and Peer Effects in Education** (with **[Marco Fongoni](https://sites.google.com/site/marcofongoni/home)**, **[Agnese Romiti](https://sites.google.com/view/agneseromiti/home)**, and Zhan Shi)

		<p>
		We study the long-run effects of income inequality within adolescent peer compositions in schools. We propose a theoretical framework based on reference dependence where inequality in peer groups can generate aspiration gaps. Guided by predictions from this framework we find that an increase in the share of low income peers within school-cohorts improves the educational outcomes of low income students and has negative effects on high income students. We further document a range of evidence that corroborates these results, including that they are distinct from peer non-linear ability effects. We then find that social cohesion, through better connections in the school network, has an important role in mitigating the effects of peer inequality. Our results provide evidence on the role of inequality in peer groups for long-run educational outcomes, while also demonstrating that there is potential to avoid these consequences.

**Marijuana Legalization and Mental Health** (with **[Daniel Borbely](https://sites.google.com/view/danielborbely/home)**, **[Otto Lenhart](https://ottolenhart.com/about-2/)** and **[Agnese Romiti](https://sites.google.com/view/agneseromiti/home)**)

	<summary><b>Abstract</b></summary>
		
		<p>
		This study examines the effects of U.S. state-level marijuana policies on mental health. Using data from three nationally representative data sets and estimating difference-in-differences models that account for the staggered implementation of both medical and recreational marijuana legislation, we evaluate the impact on marijuana use as well as two measures of mental distress. We show that marijuana laws have positive effects on marijuana use, but find no evidence for any effect on mental health on average. Nonetheless, null aggregate effects mask sharp heterogeneities across the age distribution. Our findings show that elderly individuals (age 60 and older) benefit from medical marijuana legalization in terms of better mental health, whereas legalizing recreational marijuana produces negative mental health effects for younger individuals (below age 35). The effects of medical marijuana legislation are driven by elderly people with pre-existing chronic health conditions, whereas those of recreational marijuana legislation are driven by younger and relatively healthy individuals. Furthermore, results are stronger for women than for men.
