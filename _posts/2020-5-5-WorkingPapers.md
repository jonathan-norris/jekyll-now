**Troubled in School: Does Maternal Involvement Matter for Adolescents**
> With [Martijn van Hasselt]("https://bryan.uncg.edu/faculty-and-staff/van-hasselt-martijn-nicolaas-pieter-n/") 

>We estimate the causal effect of mother's involvement on the amount of trouble an adolescent experiences in school. We use multiple measures of school trouble and factor analysis to construct a composite and then link this composite with noncognitive skills. Our measure of mother's involvement encompasses discussing school-related matters and providing help with school projects. Using an instrumental variable constructed from a suitably chosen peer group, our main finding is that an increase in maternal involvement leads to a significant decrease in school trouble. We find this result to be robust across a large number of sensitivity tests designed to account for possible selection effects, shocks at the peer group level, and further potential violations of the exclusion restriction. Additionally, we present evidence suggesting that the effect of maternal involvement may operate through its effect on adolescents' college aspirations, mental health, and the perception of parental warmth.

**The Skill Development of the Children of Immigrants**
> [With Marie Hull]("https://sites.google.com/view/mariehull/home")

>In this paper, we study the evolution of cognitive and noncognitive skills gaps for children of immigrants between kindergarten and 5th grade using two recent cohorts of elementary school students. We find some evidence that children of immigrants begin school with lower math scores than children of natives, but this gap disappears in later elementary school. For noncognitive skills, children of immigrants and children of natives score similarly in early elementary school, but a positive gap opens up in 2nd grade. We find that the growth in noncognitive skills is driven by disadvantaged immigrant students. We discuss potential explanations for the observed patterns of skill development as well as the implications of our results for the labor market prospects of children of immigrants.

**Peers and Mental Health**
>With [Lukas Kiessling]("https://lukaskiessling.github.io/")

>In this paper, we study the effects of the school environment on students' mental health. Guided by a theoretical framework, we find that having a better rank in school improves students' immediate mental health. In particular, moving a student from the 25th to the 75th percentile improves her mental health by 10-11\% of a standard deviation conditional on ability and the peer composition. These effects are more pronounced for low-ability students, persistent for more than 20 years, and carry over to economic long-run outcomes. Moreover, we document a strong asymmetry in our effects: Our results are driven by individuals receiving negative rather than positive shocks. Our results therefore provide evidence on how features of the school environment can have long-lasting consequences for individuals' well-being.
